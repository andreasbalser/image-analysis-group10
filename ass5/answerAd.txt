Are the results of 5D k-means segmentation different or significantly better?

No, I wouldn't say the results are significantly better. Both approaches (3D and 5D) do not segment the different colors perfectly due to different reflections, very similar colors and - most of the times - unlikely odds of the cluster centers falling in the perfect minima.
The results are different in the way that when including positional data, the homogeniously colored background gets segmented into two clusters.
Because, for the example of a rubix cube, positional data carries no meaningful information for clustering, I would prefer the 3D (RGB) feature space in this case.
